  "description": "WSDC Points lets you lookup various information about dancers and events that participate within WSDC. This includes how many points a dancer has and which competitions they earned those points. You can also learn which events have happened in the past and what years they were held. We've included statistics to show how long it takes dancers to rise through the competition levels and what dancers have been rising through the levels the fastest."
